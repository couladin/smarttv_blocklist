# Hosts file version of Perflyst's _Smart-TV Blocklist for Pi-hole_
Pi-hole compliant domain block list based on Perflyst's [_Smart-TV Blocklist_](https://github.com/Perflyst/PiHoleBlocklist). The list is Perflyst's property, but Pi-hole requires hosts format.

I'm manually updating this list until I get around to working how to do do git properly.
